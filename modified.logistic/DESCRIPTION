Description: This package allows for fitting of a modified logistic regression model of the form
     I(t) = \frac{K}{1 + exp\left(frac{\theta}{t} + {\omega}t + \gamma \right)}
     , where  $K, \theta, \omega, \gamma$ are constant parameters.
     This model has applications moslty in time series, especially in modelling the spread of an infectious disease in a given coutry, so in this case t is time and I(t) is the number of infected individuals.
     This package allows also for smoothing out the epidemic data in situations when we know, for example, that there is a spike in the number of reported cases on a given day due to change in the diagnostics criteria or inclusion of a large number of individuals who have been known to be infected, but were not officially reported, as it was the case, for example, with France during the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020, which on one day included all the infections from elderly care facilities which were not counted previously in the reported cases.
